Update on your GUADEC talk

Hello,

Thank you for submitting a talk for GUADEC 2018. We have had a lot of excellent
submissions this year, with strong competition for the available slots.
Unfortunately, we were not able to accept your talk, "{{paper.title}}", but we
hope to still see you in Almería!

You can find more information about getting to Almería at
https://2018.guadec.org/ . If you are planning to request travel sponsorship
from the GNOME Foundation, please follow the process at

Best regards,
The GUADEC papers team
