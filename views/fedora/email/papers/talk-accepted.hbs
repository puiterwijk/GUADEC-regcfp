Your Flock submission "{{paper.title}}" has been accepted!

Hello,

We have accepted your submission, "{{paper.title}}" for Flock this year.
We are excited to have you participate in Flock!  Below are some details
you will need to know.

Note: See the next section for action you must take immediately.

== Accepting This Offer ==
Please email flock-staff@fedoraproject.org and let us know if you can
present the talk.  If you need details about the specific scheduling
of your talk, email us.  The schedule is mostly set but is subject to
change so we are not publishing it yet.  Please either forward this
email or include the information below:

Name: 
FAS ID:
Title: {{paper.title}}
Session ID: {{paper.id}}

If you are waiting on financial assistance from us or someone else,
please email us to accept the talk and let us know it is pending your
funding decision.  See below for more information for Flock provided
financial assistance.

Please let us know in one week if you can accept the offer to present/run
a session.  After that we may offer your slot to someone on our waiting
list.

== Laptops ==
Please come prepared to use your personal laptop to present with. If
you know this is going to be a problem, let us know. We prefer that you
present from a Fedora Linux laptop, but understand if your topic requires
a different host OS.  If you would like to arrange for a loaner laptop
running Fedora Workstation, please let us know as soon as possible.

Also, try not to update your system the night before your session. This
never ends well. :)

= Financial Assistance =
Flock has a limited pool of funding available to cover travel and
lodging for accepted speakers.  If you requested funding, that will be
handled as soon as possible and you will be contacted separately.

= Invitation Letters =
If you need an invitation letter in order to secure a visa to the
United States, those will come out separately.  We will email out
questionaires to gather the required information this week.  We expect
to mail the first round of letters, once questionaires are returned,
during the week of 26 June.  If you do not have your letter by 3 July,
please email flock-staff@fedoraproject.org.  Letters are only mailed to
registered attendees.  If you need a letter you must have registered.

= Cancellation =
If you cannot attend Flock, please let us know as soon as possible.

= Schedule =
The full schedule will be available on https://flocktofedora.org when it
is complete.

On behalf of the Flock paper committee, congratulations again!
