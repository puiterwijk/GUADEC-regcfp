Update on your Flock submission

Hello,

Thank you for your submission to the Fedora Flock conference.  We had a
great call for participation with strong competition across a variety
of topics.  Unfortunately, we were not able to accept your submission,
"{{paper.title}}".  However we hope to still see you at Flock.

If you submitted multiple talks, you will receive a notification for each
submission separately. Please review each notification email carefully, as
one of your other submissions may have been accepted.

You can find more information about this year's Flock at
https://flocktofedora.org.  The full schedule will be posted there when it
is complete.

Thank you for your submission and we encourage you to try again in the future.

The Flock paper committee
